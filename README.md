# Geodes_dataset_part1
This directory shows the extraction of database schemas and class diagrams extracted via java programs (with JPA and/or Hibernate); in each directory you will find these files:

```python
-1- The class diagram which includes all the java classes that are in this project (They can be used and visualized by EMF(Eclipse Modeling Framework))
    --> allClasses.ecore
    --> allClasses.xsd 
    
-2- The class diagram which includes all entities(Domain Model or the layer of DAO (Data Access Objects)) that are in this project.
    --> DomainModel.ecore
    --> DomainModel.xsd 
    
-3- We can find several SRC directories in a single Github project (this is why we see that the name of the generated directories () is greater than the number of repo (2184 Github directory)), in the file Git_Link.txt you can find the link to SRC directory on Github.
    --> Git_Link.txt
    
-4- The relational schema implemented in the RDBMS used by this program.  
--> RelationelSchema_Inheritance.txt

-5- The mapping between the domain model (2) and the relational schema (4)
--> Mapping.txt
```
